# Recursion Program

## Description
This project demonstrates **recursion** through two classic examples:

1. **Factorial Calculation**  
   A recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
   
2. **Tower of Hanoi**  
   A recursive function that solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle by moving discs between poles.

## Features
- Interactive menu for users to choose between factorial and Tower of Hanoi.
- Clear step-by-step output showing how recursion works.
- Great for understanding how recursive calls work in practice.

## How to Run
This program can be run in any Python environment. Simply run:
```
python recursion.py
```
